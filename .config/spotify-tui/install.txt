#REQUIREMENT --> 
~NEED A SPOTIFY PREMIEM ACCOUNT
~This app uses the Web API from Spotify, which doesn't handle streaming itself.
 So you'll need either an official Spotify client
 open or a lighter weight alternative such as spotifyd.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#install using snap --> snap install spt

#spotify-tui needs to connect to Spotifyâ€™s API in order to find music by name, play tracks etc.

Instructions on how to set this up will be shown when you first run the app.

But here they are again:

Go to the Spotify dashboard :https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
Click Create an app
You now can see your Client ID and Client Secret
Now click Edit Settings
Add http://localhost:8888/callback to the Redirect URIs
Scroll down and click Save
You are now ready to authenticate with Spotify!
Go back to the terminal
Run spt
Enter your Client ID
Enter your Client Secret
Press enter to confirm the default port (8888) or enter a custom port
You will be redirected to an official Spotify webpage to ask you for permissions.
After accepting the permissions, you'll be redirected to localhost. If all goes well,
the redirect URL will be parsed automatically and now you're done. If the local webserver 
fails for some reason you'll be redirected to a blank webpage that might say something like 
"Connection Refused" since no server is running. Regardless, copy the URL and paste into the prompt in the terminal
